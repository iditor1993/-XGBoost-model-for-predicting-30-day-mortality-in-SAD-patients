Sepsis is a life-threatening infection-induced syndrome that remains a major cause of mortality in ICUs worldwide. Sepsis-associated delirium (SAD) is a serious complication that significantly increases mortality, yet it remains under-recognized and poorly predicted by conventional scoring systems. Our study leverages large-scale, publicly available critical care databases (MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD) to develop and validate a machine learning model that accurately predicts 30-day mortality in SAD patients. The findings have direct clinical relevance for early identification of high-risk patients, potentially improving targeted interventions and outcomes in this vulnerable population. 
Our study is a retrospective analysis of de-identified data from the MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD databases. All data are publicly available for research purposes, and ethical approval was waived as the data are anonymized.
